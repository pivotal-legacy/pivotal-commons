        You're surrounded by smart people working on interesting things. |

        %blockquote Having a desk at Pivotal has given Sendicate a huge boost |
        in productivity. It is invaluable to be surrounded by such intelligent |
        people you can bounce ideas off of. The physical working space is also |
        very comfortable; the standing desks and tall ceilings are especially |
        nice. The massive wall of snacks and beverages is pretty awesome, too. |

        %blockquote The amenities are a nice addition to the work environment |
        and as someone who sees clients on a regular basis it's really nice to |
        be able to offer them a cup of coffee or coconut water. |
